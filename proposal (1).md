# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Snakes and Ladder Game (Bryanna's Version)

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I am making the snakes and ladder game but with special features like (1) Extra Roll: If you land on a lucky spot, roll again. (2) Reverse Snake: Instead of going down, you move up. (3) Teleport: A special tile sends you anywhere on the board. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

  My Snakes and Ladders project will be a digtal version of the classic board game that I will develop using Pygame or Tkinter for the graphical features. In my game, players will roll a virtual dice to move across the board. They will ecounter special power-ups and traps that are bonus features for the classic game. These power-ups will include extra rolls,reverse movements, and teleportation. The software will be a two-player mode and the board will be visually apealing with visuals for dice rolls and player movement. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will accomplish a program that simulates the snake and ladder game even without the features.
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can accomplish the snakes and ladder game with my special added features.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TI hope to accompish the snakes and ladder game with my special added features and visuals to accompany.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

  To do this project, I will need to learn how to use Pygame or Tkinter for graphics and maanging animations. I would need to reasearch how to use game loops, collision detection, and smoother player movemnts. For my special power ups, I would need to make sure my effects ae applied correctly. Also I might need to to learn how to add sound effects and saving game progress. My first will be creating a basic working boards with movement and then trying to integrate my power-ups.
