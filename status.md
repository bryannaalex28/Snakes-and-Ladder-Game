I still have to implement dice rolling and player movement, implement dice rolling and player movement, add the special features (extra roll, reverse snake, and teleportation), add the playerâ€™s visual representation on the board, handle the main game loop, player actions, and victory condition.

The problems I encoutered where just file placeemnt and figuring out how to use pygame and its features. The most problem I had was with designning the board.
